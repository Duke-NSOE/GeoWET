Geospatial Wetland Evaluation Tool

This tool demonstrates a workflow that reveals in habtiat likelihood of key aquatic species in response to landscape level changes. 

Summary of workflow:
	The "Add Conservation Project" tool allows the user to draw the area of a proposed wetland (or select from an existing feature 	class). A series of landscape metrics for the catchment in which the proposed wetland occurs - as well as all downstream areas - are updated and fed into a MaxEnt model which projects habtiat likelihood of a set of aquatic species using these revised metrics. These revised habitat likelihoods are compared to likelihoods under current conditions to indicate "uplift", i.e., areas with significant increases in habitat likelihood increases.
